This research presents a comprehensive computational analysis of the Collatz conjecture using multiple advanced methodologies including complex number extensions, Markov chain modeling, neural networks, and machine learning approaches. We executed 18 different computational experiments across four major categories: Complex Variants Analysis, Markov Chain Modeling, Neural Network Prediction, and Unified Machine Learning approaches. Our findings demonstrate that while the conjecture remains unproven, computational evidence strongly supports convergence patterns, with machine learning models achieving prediction accuracies of up to 26.4% within 5 steps and R² scores reaching 0.1632.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background on the Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n+1 problem, is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. Proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937, the conjecture states that for any positive integer n, the iterative process defined by:

- If n is even: n → n/2
- If n is odd: n → 3n + 1

will always eventually reach the number 1, regardless of the starting value.

Despite its simple formulation, the conjecture has resisted all attempts at mathematical proof for over 80 years. The problem has been verified computationally for all integers up to approximately 2^68, but a general proof remains elusive.
