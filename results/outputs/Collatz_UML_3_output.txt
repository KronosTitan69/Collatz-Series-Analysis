üí° RESEARCH TIPS FOR BETTER ACCURACY:
==================================================
1. FEATURE ENGINEERING:
   ‚Ä¢ Include more number-theoretic properties (totient function, divisor count)
   ‚Ä¢ Add sequence-based features (max value reached, number of odd steps)
   ‚Ä¢ Consider modular arithmetic patterns (remainders mod various primes)

2. ADVANCED ML TECHNIQUES:
   ‚Ä¢ Try ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms
   ‚Ä¢ Use feature selection to identify most predictive features
   ‚Ä¢ Implement deep learning with careful regularization
   ‚Ä¢ Consider time-series approaches for sequence analysis

3. MATHEMATICAL APPROACHES:
   ‚Ä¢ Analyze 3x+1 trees and backward iteration
   ‚Ä¢ Study distribution in different number bases
   ‚Ä¢ Investigate connection to continued fractions
   ‚Ä¢ Apply ergodic theory and dynamical systems

4. DATA ENHANCEMENT:
   ‚Ä¢ Extend range beyond 10,000 numbers
   ‚Ä¢ Include trajectory features (path analysis)
   ‚Ä¢ Study correlation with prime gaps and density
   ‚Ä¢ Analyze periodic patterns in binary representations

5. VALIDATION STRATEGIES:
   ‚Ä¢ Cross-validate across different number ranges
   ‚Ä¢ Test predictions on much larger numbers
   ‚Ä¢ Verify patterns hold across different computational methods
   ‚Ä¢ Compare results with known theoretical bounds
